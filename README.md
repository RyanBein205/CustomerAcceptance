## Coupon Acceptance Analysis

This project explores the characteristics of drivers who are likely to accept different types of coupons, with a focus on bar and coffee house coupons. The analysis uses data from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

## Summary of Findings

- **Bar Coupons**: Younger drivers and those who are more socially active are more likely to accept bar coupons.
- **Coffee House Coupons**: Frequent coffee drinkers, especially those who visit coffee houses with friends or partners, are more inclined to accept coffee house coupons.

For a detailed analysis, please see the [Jupyter Notebook](assignment_5_1_starter%20(1)/prompt.ipynb).

## Project Organization

- data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- prompt.ipynb: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
- images: Contains images used in the README or the notebook.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyanBein205/CustomerAcceptance.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `Assignment_5_1_starter(1)` directory and open the notebook using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook prompt.ipynb
    ```

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this analysis is to determine the characteristics that influence a driver's likelihood to accept a coupon, with a detailed focus on **coffee house** coupons. By understanding these characteristics, we can provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Visualizations

Throughout the analysis, several visualizations were created to explore the differences between drivers who accepted and rejected coffee house coupons. These include:

- **Age vs. Acceptance Rate**: A line graph showing how the acceptance rate varies across different age groups.
- **Income vs. Acceptance Rate**: A bar plot illustrating the relationship between income levels and coupon acceptance.
- **Marital Status vs. Acceptance Rate**: A comparison of acceptance rates among different marital statuses.
- **Passenger Type vs. Acceptance Rate**: A bar plot demonstrating how the presence and type of passengers influence acceptance.
- **Frequency of Coffee House Visits vs. Acceptance Rate**: A line graph showing the acceptance rates based on how often drivers visit coffee houses.

## Interpretation of Findings

The following are key findings from the descriptive and inferential statistics:

- **Younger Drivers Are More Likely to Accept Coffee House Coupons**: The data indicates that drivers aged 21-26 are more inclined to accept coffee house coupons compared to older age groups.
- **Income Levels Affect Coupon Acceptance**: Acceptance rates are generally higher among lower-income groups, particularly those earning less than $50,000 annually.
- **Social Dynamics Play a Significant Role**: Drivers who are accompanied by friends or partners are more likely to accept coffee house coupons. This suggests that social outings may increase the likelihood of coupon usage.
- **Frequent Coffee Drinkers Are Prime Targets**: Drivers who visit coffee houses regularly (4-8 times a month) show the highest acceptance rates, indicating that frequent customers are more responsive to coupons.

## Actionable Insights

Based on the findings, the following actionable items are recommended:

1. **Target Younger Demographics**: Marketing efforts for coffee house coupons should focus on drivers in their 20s, who show a higher propensity to accept these offers.
2. **Leverage Social Occasions**: Consider distributing coffee house coupons in contexts where drivers are likely to be with friends or partners, as these social dynamics increase acceptance rates.
3. **Focus on Frequent Visitors**: Enhance coupon distribution to frequent coffee house visitors, especially those who visit 4-8 times a month. This group is most likely to use the coupons.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

To further refine the understanding of coupon acceptance behavior, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Expand Analysis to Other Coupon Types**: Conduct similar analyses on other coupon types (e.g., restaurants, bars) to see if similar patterns hold or if different factors influence acceptance.
2. **Implement A/B Testing**: Test the effectiveness of targeted coupon distribution based on the identified characteristics. Monitor redemption rates and adjust strategies accordingly.
3. **Personalize Coupons**: Develop personalized coupon offerings based on the demographics and behaviors identified in this analysis. For instance, younger drivers who visit coffee houses frequently could receive more appealing, tailored offers.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that influence the acceptance of coffee house coupons. By targeting younger, socially active drivers who frequent coffee houses, marketing efforts can be more effective, ultimately leading to higher coupon redemption rates.
