# Coupon Acceptance Analysis

This project explores the characteristics of drivers who are likely to accept different types of coupons, with a focus on bar and coffee house coupons. The analysis uses data from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

## Summary of Findings

- **Bar Coupons**: Younger drivers and those who are more socially active are more likely to accept bar coupons.
- **Coffee House Coupons**: Frequent coffee drinkers, especially those who visit coffee houses with friends or partners, are more inclined to accept coffee house coupons.

For a detailed analysis, please see the [Jupyter Notebook](prompt.ipynb.ipynb).
